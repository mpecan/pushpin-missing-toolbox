## Development Process

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build all modules
./gradlew build

# Build a specific module
./gradlew :server:build

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Run integration tests
./gradlew integrationTest
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start Pushpin servers
docker-compose up -d

# Run the application
./gradlew bootRun

# Or run with specific profile
./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev'
```

### Project Modules

- `server/` - Main Spring Boot application
- `pushpin-api/` - GRIP protocol implementation
- `pushpin-client/` - Client library for publishing messages
- `pushpin-testcontainers/` - Testcontainers implementation
- `discovery-*` - Service discovery modules
- `pushpin-security-*` - Security modules
- `pushpin-transport-*` - Transport modules

## Style Guidelines

### Kotlin Style

We follow the [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) with some additions:

```kotlin
// Classes: PascalCase
class PushpinServer

// Functions: camelCase
fun getBaseUrl(): String

// Properties: camelCase
val controlPort: Int

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
const val DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 5000

// Test methods: use backticks for descriptive names
@Test
fun `should publish message successfully when server is healthy`() {
    // test implementation
}
```

### Code Organization

```kotlin
// Order of class members
class ExampleService {
    // 1. Companion object
    companion object {
        private val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ExampleService::class.java)
    }
    
    // 2. Properties
    private val timeout = Duration.ofSeconds(30)
    
    // 3. Initialization block
    init {
        // initialization code
    }
    
    // 4. Constructors
    constructor(param: String) : this()
    
    // 5. Public methods
    fun publicMethod() { }
    
    // 6. Private methods
    private fun helperMethod() { }
}
```

### Documentation

- All public APIs must have KDoc comments
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Keep comments concise and meaningful

```kotlin
/**
 * Publishes a message to all healthy Pushpin servers.
 * 
 * @param message The message to publish
 * @return Mono<Boolean> indicating success
 * @throws PushpinException if no healthy servers are available
 * 
 * @sample
 * ```
 * val message = Message.simple("channel", mapOf("data" to "hello"))
 * pushpinService.publishMessage(message).block()
 * ```
 */
fun publishMessage(message: Message): Mono<Boolean>
```

## Testing

### Test Requirements

- All new features must have tests
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Write both unit and integration tests when applicable

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run tests for a specific module
./gradlew :server:test

# Run a specific test class
./gradlew test --tests "*.PushpinServiceTest"

# Run with coverage
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```

### Writing Tests

```kotlin
@SpringBootTest
@Testcontainers
class PushpinIntegrationTest {
    
    @Container
    val pushpinContainer = PushpinContainerBuilder()
        .withPreset(PushpinPresets.minimal())
        .build()
    
    @Test
    fun `should handle message publishing`() {
        // Given
        val message = TestDataBuilder.message()
        
        // When
        val result = pushpinService.publishMessage(message).block()
        
        // Then
        assertThat(result).isTrue()
    }
}
```
