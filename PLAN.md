# Pushpin Missing Toolbox Implementation Plan

## Overview
This project aims to create an open-source solution for managing multiple Pushpin servers and allowing systems to interact with them. The solution will:
- Expose configurations for setting up authentication mechanisms
- Provide endpoints to distribute messages to Pushpin servers
- Include all required setup for developers to work on this project

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Local Development Environment Setup
1. **Docker Compose Setup**
   - Create a docker-compose.yml file to run one or more Pushpin servers locally
   - Configure networking between the application and Pushpin servers
   - Set up volume mounts for Pushpin configuration
   - Enable easy scaling of Pushpin instances for testing

2. **Basic Project Structure**
   - Set up Spring Boot application structure
   - Configure build system (Gradle)
   - Define package structure

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
1. **Pushpin Server Management**
   - Create models for Pushpin server configuration
   - Implement service to manage Pushpin server connections
   - Add health check mechanisms

2. **Authentication Mechanism**
   - Define authentication configuration options
   - Implement authentication service
   - Add security filters

3. **Message Distribution**
   - Create endpoints for publishing messages
   - Implement load balancing across multiple Pushpin servers
   - Add retry and failover mechanisms

### Phase 3: Developer Experience
1. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive README
   - Add API documentation
   - Include examples and usage scenarios

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests with Pushpin
   - Performance tests for message distribution

3. **CI/CD Setup**
   - Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Set up release process

## Getting Started
To start working on this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `docker-compose up` to start the Pushpin server(s)
3. Run the Spring Boot application
4. Access the API documentation at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
